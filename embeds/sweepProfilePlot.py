window_editSweepProfile.py

This file defines a class WindowEditConfig which creates a window object
that can be used to create a new sweep profile (if blank) or to edit
an existing profile. There are two ways to edit an existing profile because
there are two places a profile may be stored:
    1. In a standalone sweep profile file (with .ovp extention for 'Open Voltam Profile')
    2. Embedded in an Open Voltam sample file (.ovs).
In the first case, this window is passed a path to the .ovp file. If so,
it loads the sweep profile info which can be edited and either saved back to the
same file or Save-as'd to a new file name/location.
In the second case, both the path of the .ovs file as well as the unique ID of
the stored sweep profile is passed. As this is not being imported from a standalone
file, when "save" is pressed, it prompts the user to select a location and name
for the new file.

Both .ovs and .ovp files use tabular json format (an extension of json that allows
for tabular, comma-separated-value type data to be embedded within a json.
